I can't connect. LG Bridge is software available for Windows PC or Mac OS that lets you backup, restore, and update your LG phone, and transfer files wirelessly between computer and LG phone.

Altogether with full of security and with the comfortable environment. Stay free connectivity and perform different tasks… I've had LG G6 for about 2 months (first LG phone), and I've just discovered LG AirDrive for sharing files to my computers. It's great! I haven't heard many good things about LG Bridge, but this feature is awesome, and it appears The LG Electronics "Product Registration" Sweepstakes is open to legal residents of the 50 United States and D.C., age 18 or older at the time of entry. Void outside the U.S., in Puerto Rico, and wherever else prohibited Used the phone from 26th Jan. My thoughts below: 1. PROS: Performance - Biggest improvement. This phone is snappy AF. V20's old processor meant everything used to lag, this is such an improved experience for me. V20 - camera app used to take 10sec to load up. V40, nothing takes more than 1sec. Tip: Reduce animations to 0.5x in developer options Cameras - The V20 had average cameras (garbage front cams). It's manual mode salvaged it. The V40 has great cameras right LG Airdrive is a software to make bridge connection among Lg phone and PC. You can work with your phones and tablets to manage them on Windows.

Overview. LG AirDrive is a Shareware software in the category Home & Hobby developed by LG Electronics. It was checked for updates 314 times by the users of our client application UpdateStar during the last month. The latest version of LG AirDrive is 1.2.60617.11, released on 08/01/2016. I have problem with LG Bridge. It's connected, everything works fine, I can see my LG files on PC, but I can't found Shared PC folder on my phone. I read "Help", and they write - Go to your File Manager, Tap Menu, and select LG AirDrive, And go to your shared folder, BUT problem is that, there is no Menu icon or something like LG AirDrive in File Manager. SO WHERE I can found my Shared PC folder on my phone. Thanks. LG AirDrive can wirelessly connect your device to your computer to manage copy, move, or delete files from your device. Note: LG AirDrive must be pre-installed on your mobile device to work and can not be downloaded. I have connected my phone via usb and turned on file transfer and turned on debugging but the bridge software doesn't appear to see it via usb. I was able to get it to work with LG AirDrive but that doesn't help with the software update. Anyone know what I am doing wrong. Download the 5★ LG AirDrive 4.70 4.70.7 at Aptoide now! Virus and Malware free No extra costs. I'm trying to sign into LG Bridge on PC updated to 1.2.8 (which appears to be the latest version). After I successfully sign into my Google account (which my phone is signed into, even in the LG AirDrive service), the software temporarily freezes, then comes back as if nothing happened and it's still not signed into the account. Anyone faced this issue before. The package provides the installation files for LG Mobile AirDrive Device Driver version 8.45.41.242. If the driver is already installed on your system, updating (overwrite-installing) may fix various issues, add new functions, or just upgrade to the available version. LG AirDrive enables you to see files stored in your mobile device, such as images, audio, videos  and document files on a PC. Click the name of the device connected via LG AirDrive to display files. You can also access the files by going to Computer > Portable Devices and clicking on the device. I just got an LG G6 used from a friend. I ust found out airdrive is a thing, but I can't seem to find it anywhere in my phone. amp#x200B; Edit: Unrelated (but maybe related?), in LG Bridge, even if I plug the phone in over USB, LG Bridge won't seem to recognise the phone, even though Android File Transfer recognises 
Has anyone got LG Bridge to work on their Mac? It downloaded just fine for me, but whenever I open it says AirDrive needs an update and when I press yes it "updates" and then closes. When I reopen it asks to update again, blocking me from signing. If airdrive/bridge is a wifi lan\-based file transfer utility, why is an LG account required? It's asking I need help connecting my G5 to my computer. I have been trying to search everywhere for a solution but still have not been able to connect my G5 to my Windows 10 computer. The phone doesn't show the USB dialoge to choose USB mode when I connect it, it will not charge properly, will only show the flash but not the animated charging battery icon and on top of that the airdrive is not working properly either. It seems to be just my computer since it works fine on my job computer that run Windows. 
Has anyone else got LG Bridge working? I've downloaded the OSX app. When I go to AirDrive I get the sign-in page, with the option to sign in with Google. I enter my details, it asks for the 2-step code, then it dumps me back at the same sign-in page. Then the window closes. I'm not signed in. Same on my phone. If I go to Accounts, I can tap on LG Account and sign in with Google. It then tells me to sign in again with Google. If I try to set up a new account, it tells me my email address Is there some trick to getting the Bridge software to work with the G4? Or is it only compatible with certain models? My PC recognizes the phone, I've uninstalled and reinstalled the drivers and Bridge software multiple times. Rebooted each. I can connect with AirDrive but if I try to do a software update, it says that AirDrive is busy. Trying to connect with USB cable, it just sits on connecting, then says try again. The software version i have is 20a and the LG site says the latest 다른 표현을 사용해주시기 바랍니다. 건전한 인터넷 문화 조성을 위해 회원님의 적극적인 협조를 부탁드립니다. 안녕하세요? 안테나곰입니다. 스마트폰을 사용하다보면, 음악파일이나 가지고 있는 사진/동영상 파일을 스마트폰에. 네트워크 탭-항목이 많아서 스크롤을 내려야 LG AirDrive를 찾으실수 있습니다.
